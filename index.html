    <h2 id='intro'>Introduction</h2>
    <p>There is very little that is comparable to the beauty of a glass painting. The effect of light streaming through the patterns of painted glass is indeed ethereal.</p>
    <p>For several hundreds of years, the only way to paint on glass was to fire-in metallic oxides for details on the back of the glass (the lovely old art of backpainting). However, transparent glass paints become available some years ago, with simpler
      methods offering the amateurs far more scope.</p>
    <p>You can compare real stained glass with patchwork, and painted glass with applique. The colour in real stained glass is a part of the glass itself, and the window is pieced together like patchwork from accurately cut shapes, using an ‘H’ shaped section
      of lead, with the joints soldered to create one flat piece. The cost of a stained glass window reflects the skilled craftsmanship that goes into making it, specialist tools, workshop overheads and individual pieces of beautiful glass, some of which
      will be cut away and wasted of course.</p>
    <p>In complete contrast, armed with some glass paints, outline paste and glass jars, a group of children can easily paint jam jar lanterns for an evening around a camp fire. True, it is not the real thing, but many of us would not have the facilities or the time for that. Glass paints have made the great pleasure of working in pure colour more accessible to us all. Many a day-centre has reported the therapeutic effects of colour, while teaching groups have also been excited by the new possibilities.

    <h2 id='history'>The Origin and Spread of Glass Painting</h2>
    <p>It is difficult to say exactly when and where glass painting originated, but it is believed that the revitalization of art that took place during the Italian Renaissance gave birth to this beautiful form of painting. Glass paintings during the Renaissance
      were in the miniature style, and dealt with Biblical themes. They adorned church altars and windows.</p>
    <p>The art of glass painting gained more sophistication In Austria, and it slowly spread all over Europe. It did not take it too long to reach Asia either.</p>
    <h2 id=techniques>The Technique of Glass Painting</h2>
    <p>Glass paintings are sometimes called stained glass paintings. This name hints at the process of creation. An engraving is laid down on the back of the glass. The designs are outlined. Thereafter, special glass paints are applied. These paints are
      water or gum arabic based. They are fired onto the glass using a kiln. The heat of the kiln ensures that they permanently bond with the glass. Since glass paintings are painted on the reverse, they are also called reverse glass paintings. </p>
    <h2 id='GPtoday'>Glass Painting Today</h2>
    <p>Development of synthetic colors has gone a long way in keeping the art of glass painting alive. Art enthusiasts can buy their own glass painting kits and experiment with this art form. Today, almost every other household is adorned with a stained
      glass painting.</p>
    <p>Taking inspiration from the luminous beauty of stained glass, painting on glass is a simple yet dramatically effective decorative technique which can be enjoyed by people of all ages and artistic ability.</p>
    <p>Turning a plain, flat piece of glass into a sumptuous roundel is the perfect place to start, allowing you to become familiar with the materials and try out the trace-off motifs or your own freehand patterns. From here you can progress on to decorating
      glasses, bottles, trinket, boxes, mirrors, picture frames, vases, cabinet doors, storage jars and the many other ideas <a target='_blank' id='tribute-link' href='https://www.boredart.com/2017/06/glass-painting-ideas-for-beginners.html'>presented here.</a> Detailed step-by-step instructions are accompanied by specially commissioned colour photographs of the projects to ensure success every time.</p>
